# Beeline Pest Control

This is a redesign site for Beeline Pest Control.

## 🔍 Overview

The original site struggled with responsiveness and user interaction.
The revision focused on those issues, keeping all the content the same while enhancing the user experience.

This site showcases my skills in staying true to the owners theme and content while bringing functionality and clarity.
